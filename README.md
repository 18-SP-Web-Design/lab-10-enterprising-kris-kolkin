# Lab 10 - Enterprising 

For this lab, you will employ some of the basic JQuery techniques and strategies to make a website the behaves dynamically.

Load the page and you will notice that there are three images and three buttons in the Middle. When the user selects a ship, all other options and buttons should disappear. Also, the menu button in the top left corner should cause a sidebar menu to appear. Altogether, you are to write JavaScript/jQuery code which does the following.

Complete the jQuery function in `index.js` to:

* When the menu button is pressed, the menu bar will animate, so that it comes in to a width of 160px and pushes the main body content of the page over by the same amount.
    * Make this a toggle, so that pressing it again causes the menu to disappear.
* When you click any button below a picture of a ship:
    * The other ships disappear (using some sort of jquery animation
    * All buttons disappear so the choice is "permanent"

Push your repository back here when finished.
